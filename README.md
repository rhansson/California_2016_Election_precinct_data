# California_2016_Election_precinct_data
California precincts in TopoJSON format

When developing [geotuple.org](http://rhansson.github.io/geotuple/), I was looking for detailed voting district (precicnt) boundaries and came across [this repository](https://github.com/datadesk/california-2016-election-precinct-maps) from the The Los Angeles Times Data Desk. They had already done an excellent job of organizing all the data, but for my need I thought I could tidy up the geographic data just a bit.
